# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying After Build

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply after the build process.  The issue manifests only in the production build, leaving the development build unaffected.

## Problem Description

Styles defined with Tailwind CSS classes work correctly during development, but after a build (e.g., using Vite, Webpack, etc.), some or all classes are not applied, resulting in unstyled elements. 

This bug is difficult to track because it's build-environment dependent and doesn't produce readily apparent error messages.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the development server (instructions may vary depending on the build tool used).
3. Observe that the Tailwind CSS classes apply correctly.
4. Build the application for production.
5. Deploy the built application and notice that the styles are missing or incorrect.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrect Build Configuration:** The most common cause is a misconfiguration of the build process, which might not properly process or include the Tailwind CSS directives.
* **Plugin Conflicts:** Conflicting plugins might interfere with the Tailwind CSS processing.
* **Caching Issues:** Build caching might cause outdated versions of CSS to be used.
* **PurgeCSS Configuration:** If using PurgeCSS to remove unused CSS, an incorrect configuration may lead to necessary styles being removed.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, with potential solutions elaborated below:

* **Check your build configuration**: Ensure that Tailwind CSS directives are correctly processed during the build process.
* **Verify PurgeCSS configuration**: If you're using PurgeCSS ensure you haven't accidentally removed necessary styles. Update the `content` array to include all templates.
* **Clean and rebuild**: Clear the build cache and perform a clean rebuild.
* **Inspect the generated CSS**: Check whether Tailwind classes are present in the final CSS output.
* **Review plugin compatibility**:  If you use any other CSS frameworks or plugins, make sure there are no compatibility conflicts.
